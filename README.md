These implementations have been tested. You can use these implementations at your own discretion.

In my implementations, I try my best to stick to the specifications of the original founders. In the case that I'm aware that I'm diverging from the original specifications, I will mention it below and in the implementation.

# Data Structures

## B-Trees

The implementation found here has the following features:

- Supports keys of any data type
- Supports traversal
- Supports even orders (the original specification only supports odd orders)

The implementation has yet to be checked if it supports duplicate keys
